The research proposed an innovative approach -- a generative system to rethinking the data visualization process. It argues that the visualization of cultural archives is objective and biased in its traditional research process, as the researcher might prioritize certain viewpoints based on the socio-cultural conditions at that time. The generative approach would bridge the gaps in the archive process; it would also democratize the 'sole decision-making power of the archives in the formation of cultural heritage.'

The sets of matrixes the author developed are enlightening in that it offers new perspectives when users choose different parameter combinations to explore a topic. The layering of information allows users to investigate further and understand the relevance of a multitude of information that doesn't necessarily share the same metric unit.

This research paper also provides insights and inspiration for our project, the Dutch art website. We could also develop the idea of layering to create an interface that allows for the combination of a variety of information, with the visual representation of these contents through different space configurations, homogenous ones, and variable-dependent ones.
