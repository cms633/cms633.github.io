"So the Colors Cover the Wires": Interface, Aesthetics, and Usability by Matthew G. Kirschenbaum

In the article, Kirschenbaum commented on how 'the visual (and aural, or tactile and olfactory) elements on the page or screen function as integral aspects of the information experience rather than as afterthoughts to some "pre-existing bundle of functionality".' Kirschenbaum further points out that the debate on interface transparency mirrors the debate in literary studies over the nature of a book's 'contact surface' and the role of its physical and material features in the production of the meaning of a text.

Aesthetic:

The success of Apple is hinged heavily on its product design. While most software and websites have pragmatic or functional ends, Apple's OS X interface encourages users to cultivate an aesthetic sensibility even in the most mundane corners of the desktop. The clean and minimalist interface only keeps what is necessary and reduces the complexity, making it distinct from other competing products. 

Some questions to consider:
How do we define an interface to be aesthetic? What kind of aesthetic are we pursuing in interface design?
What role should aesthetics have in interface design? Should beauty in interface design play a complementary role in enhancing functionality? Or should it be the drive for developers to rethink the content and create new experiences for users to interact with it? 
How do we balance the competing demands of function and beauty?' How will the design balance efficiency, ease of use, and user agency?

Usability:

In the last section 'Blake Archive for Humans', the author also talked about the competing demands of humans and machines and how it is hard to strike a balance in interface design to meet various users' needs.
This also applies to our final project where our Dutch Art website design also has different interface design for various needs: a mindmap interface for users who want to explore more deeply the relationship between artworks; a gallery interface for users who just want to browse without specific aim; as well as a map-based interface for users who want to check nearby exhibits and locations for certain artworks.

Will the users who wish to engage more deeply be permitted to trace the wires to their source? Or will the interface enforce a clean line between who's in and out, makers and users, producers and consumers? How will the concept of the user be inscribed or circumscribed in DH's emergent design?
How could we test if an interface is usable?
To what extent should users to included in designing and building DH? How participatory and reflexive will that process be?
