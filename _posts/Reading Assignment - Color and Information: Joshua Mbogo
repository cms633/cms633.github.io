Out of the four different ways that one can use color the one that resonated with me and I believe has the most use is color as a label. He uses the example of labeling different shapes in a mathematical explination of the pythagorem theorem as an example. When used correct colors as label reinforce existing ideas if that be for a mathematical problem or diagram. In the example mentioned one way the author used color was to group shapes of the same type together. Obviously shapes that are the same will look the same but when there area alot of measurements occuring in a diagram its nice to have congruent and similar shapes grouped together visually through color. It brings an extra demension of information and connection to any piece of work.
