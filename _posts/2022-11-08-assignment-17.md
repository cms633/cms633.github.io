Data visualization is usually biased and coded with the author's intent of what messages would like to be conveyed. Deception in data visualization happens on many levels, from how the reader reads the data to how they interpret data. Message exaggeration is apparent in our daily life, e.g., how Tim Cook presents Apple's cumulative sales data without having a precise quantity scale for the y-axis. Depending on what unit the y-axis is, the visualization would be very different (billions of iPhone sales vs. hundreds of iPhone sales). The exaggerated graph misleads users to think iPhones sales are increasing because cumulative data is always increasing, but in reality, iPhone's quarterly sales are decreasing.
Message reversal is also confusing to inattentive readers (e.g. the Gun Death in Florida chart). The author takes advantage of readers' habit to read from bottom to top and purposefully reversing the measurement to decrease the negative response to the data shown.
As designers, when we visualize data, we must be careful with the methods and type of measurements we use to provide an unbiased data analysis. We must also consider readers' digital literacy and familiarity with the data context.
