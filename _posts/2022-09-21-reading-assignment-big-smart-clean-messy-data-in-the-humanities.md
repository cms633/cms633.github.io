**1.Introduction**

Most humanistic researchers would not consider their object of study “data,” but most of their research is surrounded by understanding large amounts of data. And as the works become more digitized, the author highlights that questions of ethicacy start to arise. 

**2.What is data (in the humanities)?**

Luciano Floridi defines data as the absence of uniformity, and is considered information when given uniformity. This can be similar to saying that there needs to be an expressed interpretation of the data to be  considered information, but this also leads to the fact that the information could very well be biased. But if the interpretation is solely based on the data, is it essentially the data’s fault (the lack of it) for a false/biased expression of information to the general public. 

Data can be expressed in the form of hierarchical or multi-relational structures, and can be either structured, semi-structured or unstructured. Another distinction is data or metadata. There are various versions in which the dataset can be expressed, and each can provide valuable knowledge of a specific area in not only humanities, but also the sciences. 

Since most data in the humanities at the center of the research is analog and non-discrete, it is relatively difficult to computationally derive information from these data, which it makes sense that this has led many humanities researchers to have doubts about this method of analysis. But regardless of the actual perception of data, it is clear there is a disconnect from what traditionalist researchers see as “data,” and what digital researchers consider “data.” 

Data is purely meant to be created, not essentially given. Data is a digital, selectively, constructed, machine-actionable abstraction representing some aspects of a given object of humanistic inquiry. This clarifies that data essentially is used to get to the object of the study, but not the actual study entirely. 

**3.Smart Data**

The data within this branch is usually the information that is placed upon documents within the digital sphere, including the various markups, annotations, and metadata. Although this type of data is easily handled, since it is relatively limited in the amount of data, it’s scalability or the information that can be drawn from them is severely limited to its original purpose. 

**4.Big Data**

Big data is essentially the opposite of smart data, where there exists no singular purpose for the data, but contains unstructured, messy data to gather new insights about the area. The user doesn’t enact a singular purpose, but rather the data reveals new insights about itself. Volume, Variety, and Velocity. There is also less of a focus on literary conventions, but more on statistics and probabilities. 

**5.Conclusion**

Author believes that the humanities largest issue would be to transgress this opposition to smart and big data, instead of making the situation the one or the other. Some solutions the author includes are crowdsourcing, and automatic annotation.
