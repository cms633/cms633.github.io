Fourth rule: If a picture is composed of two or more large, enclosed areas in different colors, the picture falls apart. Unity will be maintained, however, if the colors of one area are repeatedly intermingled in the other if the colors are interwoven carpet-fashion throughout the other.

This rule applies to the painting of Mondrian, where multiple colors are used to compose the whole picture, but with different proportions to emphasize red and blue colors, the image still gives a sense of balance. The color also has visual weight -- with white and yellow being the lightest and darker colors like red and blue being the heaviest. A clear visual hierarchy is created by putting red and blue in the majority across the diagonal line and making the rest of the areas yellow.

Another example of how intermingled colors create unity can be seen from the USGS Geologic Map of North America. ([Map link](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:USGS_Geologic_Map_of_North_America.jpg)) As different colors encode different geological rock formations, the colorful map demonstrates the diverse and rich layers of geology within the North American region. Rule three also applies here with the background in muted grey colors to make the colors stand out.

Another interesting example: Summer Streets Smellmapping Astor Place, NYC by artist Kate McLean. ([Map link](https://sensorymaps.com/?projects=summer-streets-smellmapping-astor-place-nyc))
