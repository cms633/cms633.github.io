The text goes through not only the implications of timelines and related structures but their history. The history gives a context of timelines and gives a foundation to explain the benefits and usefulness of timelines. However, with these positive aspects in mind their are still drawbacks to time lines and how they display information. The benefits I believe are quite obvious as timelines organize information neatly and simplify very complex sequential events into easily consumable bullet points or similar strucutres. But with this simplicity readers loses specificity and many times temporal granualrity of events depending on the density of items on the timeline. The density can be describe by the range of time the time line covers respective to how often a signficant event happended. If the density is high many times the author of the timeline must summarize multiple events into one or all together remove events to keep the integrity and easy consumption of information that timelines allow.
